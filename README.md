A Compose Multiplatform Navigation library which support Platform Native Features like Predictive Back Gesture(Android), Swipe-Back Gesture(iOS), Shared Element Transition(Common).
This library adopts a screen transition pattern based on NavHost, similar to the Jetpack Navigation library. A key difference is that it allows for customization of the Predictive Back animation separately."

## Supported targets
* `android`
* `ios`
* `web` (`IR` and `Wasm`)
* `desktop` (`jvm` and `macOS`)

Check out the [project website](https://easternkite.github.io/eungabi) for detailed guides.

## Installation
```toml
[versions]
eungabi = "0.3.0"

[libraries]
eungabi = { module = "io.github.easternkite:eungabi", version.ref = "eungabi" }
```

## Quick Start
> You can write code simply, in a style similar to the Jetpack Navigation Compose. A detailed guide has scheduled. (comming soon ðŸ¤— )
```kotlin
val controller = rememberEunGabiController()
EunGabiNavHost(
    modifier = Modifier,
    controller = egController,
    startDestination = "main",
) {
    composable("main") {
        MainComponent("main") {
            egController.navigate("details")
        }
    }
    composable("details") {
        DetailsComponent(
            "details",
            onNavigateBack = egController::navigateUp
        ) {
            egController.navigate("detailA")
        }
    }
}
```
## Passing Arguments
you can simply pass arguments by adding query parameter when calling `navigate` function. For example :
```kotlin
controller.navigate("ScreenA?id=111")
```

Then, you can access the passed arguments within a composable function defined in `EungabiGraphBuilder`. For example :
```kotlin
fun EunGabiGraphBuilder.aScreenRoute() {
    composable("ScreenA") {
        val id = it.arguments.getString("id")
        Screen(id = id)
    }
}
```
